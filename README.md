# DScanner
[About]
Scanner allows you to input a url and try's different terms from a json file to see if the url has a directory with those terms.
Discover hidden, sensitive or vulnerable files and routes in web applications and servers. You can use the program to find hidden files and directories on a web server by fuzzing.

[Fuzzing]
Is a discovery activity that allows you to discover resources that were not meant to be publicly accessible (e.g. /backups, /index.php.old, /archive.tgz, /source_code.zip etc.).

Please do not use DScanner without the permission of the website/host.

[How it works]
DScanner uses a custom-built wordlist for discovering hidden files and directories. The wordlist contains more than 1000 common names. You are able to use your own word list in json format.
